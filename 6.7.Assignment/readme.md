# Overview
This repository contains two main machine learning projects utilizing the Perceptron algorithm: one for classifying surgical data and another for predicting weather temperatures. Each project uses supervised learning techniques, and the Perceptron model is applied linearly on both datasets.

## Surgical Data Classification üè®

### Project Overview
In this project, the goal is to classify binary-labeled surgical data using an object-oriented Perceptron algorithm.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Training the Perceptron**: Implemented a Perceptron model and applied it to the surgical dataset for binary classification.
2. **Experimenting with Activation Functions**: Five different activation functions were tested, including `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `ReLU`, `linear`, and others.
3. **Accuracy and Loss Visualization**:
   - Plotted accuracy and loss metrics for both training and test datasets for each epoch.

### Plots
- **Accuracy Plot**: Displays model accuracy over each training epoch for both training and test datasets.
- **Loss Plot**: Shows loss over each training epoch for both training and test datasets.

## Weather Prediction üå¶Ô∏è

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict a city‚Äôs temperature based on historical hourly weather data recorded over several years. This dataset captures temperature on an hourly basis for each day of the year.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Converted various dates into a ‚Äúday of the year‚Äù format (e.g., May 2 = day 33, December 29 = day 365).
   - Calculated the average daily temperature based on the 24 hourly measurements available for each day.
2. **Plotting Average Temperature**: A plot was created showing the average temperature for each day of the year.

3. **Linear Perceptron Modeling**: A linear Perceptron model was trained on the processed data.

4. **Functions**:
   - **Evaluate Function**: A function to evaluate the model‚Äôs performance.
   - **Predict Function**: A function to predict temperature for a given day of the year.

5. **Weight and Bias Saving**: The trained weights and bias values were saved as `.npy` files for further use.

### Important Plots During Training
- **Loss**: Visualizes the model‚Äôs training loss across epochs.
- **Accuracy**: Shows the accuracy achieved during training.

> **Note**: Although the dataset is not linearly separable, a linear model was intentionally chosen to meet exercise requirements. Therefore, the results are not expected to be ideal.
